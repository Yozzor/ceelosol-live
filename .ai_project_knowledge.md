# CeeloSol Project Knowledge

## Project Overview
CeeloSol is a Solana-based gambling app with React/TypeScript frontend and Node.js backend, deployed on Render. The app features real-time multiplayer lobbies with WebSocket communication.

## Current Issue
**Lobby UI Sync Issues - Real-time Player Visibility**
- Players joining lobbies aren't visible in real-time to other players
- Frontend timeout fallback mechanism (5 seconds) is being triggered
- Socket connection and lobby joining work, but lobby state updates have timing issues
- Console shows "Timeout waiting for lobby update, falling back to immediate navigation"

## Issue Analysis
The lobby synchronization problem stems from:
1. **Frontend Event Handling**: Timeout fallback mechanism triggers before proper lobby updates
2. **State Management**: Race condition between socket events and UI state updates
3. **Real-time Sync**: Players joining lobbies aren't immediately visible to existing players
4. **Backend Timing**: While backend uses `setImmediate()`, frontend event listeners may not be properly synchronized

## Active Tasks
- [x] Analyze frontend lobby event handling and timeout mechanism
- [x] Improve real-time lobby state synchronization
- [x] Fix race conditions in lobby player visibility
- [ ] Test multi-player lobby joining scenarios
- [ ] Ensure immediate player visibility when joining lobbies

## Completed Tasks
- Fixed boolean | null type issues in getAuthenticationStatus function
- Added missing safeWord property to WalletData objects in auth.tsx
- Updated register function return type to include safeWord
- Successfully restarted development server on localhost:3000
- Fixed missing safe word in wallet generation UI (AppAccessManager.tsx)
- Added safe word display field in wallet creation modal
- Added "Copy Safe Word" button to modal
- Updated instructions to emphasize safe word importance
- **MAJOR FIX**: Implemented safe word authentication in login flow
- Modified WalletAccessControl.tsx to use safeWordAuth.ts system
- Added conditional safe word input field that appears when required
- Updated authentication logic to require safe word for protected wallets
- Added proper error handling and user feedback for safe word authentication
- **SOCKET FIX**: Resolved lobby creation "Not connected to server" race condition
- Enhanced connection state management in SocketService.js
- Added auto-retry mechanism for socket state synchronization issues
- Improved connection checking in createLobby, joinLobby, requestLobbies methods
- **LOBBY SYNC FIX**: Resolved real-time lobby player visibility issues
- Fixed race condition in frontend event listener setup for lobby joining
- Improved timing coordination between frontend and backend lobby updates
- Added duplicate event emission in backend to ensure frontend receives updates
- Reduced timeout fallback from 5 seconds to 2 seconds for better responsiveness
- Enhanced event handling with promise-based approach and proper cleanup

## Research Findings
- Socket.IO `socket.join()` is asynchronous and requires proper timing coordination
- Backend correctly uses `setImmediate()` to ensure room joining completes before emitting updates
- Frontend has 5-second timeout fallback that's being triggered due to timing issues
- Real-time lobby updates require proper event listener management and state synchronization
- Socket.IO rooms work correctly but frontend event handling needs optimization

## Implementation Notes
- Safe word authentication is critical security feature
- Multiple storage layers for wallet persistence
- Need to ensure backward compatibility with existing wallets
