# CeeloSol Project Knowledge

## Project Overview
CeeloSol is a Solana-based gambling app with React/TypeScript frontend and Node.js backend, deployed on Render. The app features real-time multiplayer lobbies with WebSocket communication.

## Current Issue
**TypeScript Compilation Errors & Server Down**
- Multiple TypeScript errors related to missing `safeWord` property in type definitions
- Development server has stopped responding (localhost refused to connect)
- Errors in `src/lib/safeWordAuth.ts` and `src/util/auth.tsx`

## Error Analysis
The errors indicate that:
1. `WalletData` interface requires `safeWord: string` property
2. `WalletInfo` interface requires `safeWord: string` property  
3. Functions returning these types are missing the `safeWord` property
4. Some functions return `boolean | null` instead of `boolean`

## Active Tasks
- [x] Fix TypeScript compilation errors in safeWordAuth.ts
- [x] Fix TypeScript compilation errors in auth.tsx
- [x] Restart development server
- [x] Verify application loads correctly

## Completed Tasks
- Fixed boolean | null type issues in getAuthenticationStatus function
- Added missing safeWord property to WalletData objects in auth.tsx
- Updated register function return type to include safeWord
- Successfully restarted development server on localhost:3000
- Fixed missing safe word in wallet generation UI (AppAccessManager.tsx)
- Added safe word display field in wallet creation modal
- Added "Copy Safe Word" button to modal
- Updated instructions to emphasize safe word importance
- **MAJOR FIX**: Implemented safe word authentication in login flow
- Modified WalletAccessControl.tsx to use safeWordAuth.ts system
- Added conditional safe word input field that appears when required
- Updated authentication logic to require safe word for protected wallets
- Added proper error handling and user feedback for safe word authentication
- **SOCKET FIX**: Resolved lobby creation "Not connected to server" race condition
- Enhanced connection state management in SocketService.js
- Added auto-retry mechanism for socket state synchronization issues
- Improved connection checking in createLobby, joinLobby, requestLobbies methods

## Research Findings
- `WalletData` interface (src/lib/walletPersistence.ts) requires `safeWord: string`
- `WalletInfo` interface (src/lib/walletGen.ts) requires `safeWord: string`
- Safe word system is part of two-factor authentication
- Functions need to handle null values properly and convert to boolean

## Implementation Notes
- Safe word authentication is critical security feature
- Multiple storage layers for wallet persistence
- Need to ensure backward compatibility with existing wallets
