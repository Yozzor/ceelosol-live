# 🎲 Real-Time Activity Feed Feature

## ✅ **Feature Implemented Successfully**

I've successfully implemented a **real-time activity feed** that shows recent wins with privacy-protected wallet addresses, exactly as you requested!

## 🎯 **What Was Added**

### 1. **ActivityFeed Component** (`src/components/ActivityFeed.js`)
- **Real-time win tracking**: Shows recent player wins as they happen
- **Privacy protection**: Wallet addresses are shortened (e.g., `A5DL...5nTmu`)
- **Win details**: Shows dice roll, result type, and SOL amount won
- **Treasury monitoring**: Displays house bank balance and live status
- **GTA-style theming**: Matches your San Andreas aesthetic

### 2. **Treasury Monitor Service** (`src/services/TreasuryMonitor.js`)
- **Real-time balance monitoring**: Watches treasury wallet for changes
- **Automatic win detection**: Detects when treasury pays out (player wins)
- **Background polling**: Checks balance every 5 seconds
- **Activity notifications**: Notifies components of wins/losses

### 3. **Enhanced DiceTable Integration**
- **Automatic activity logging**: When players win, adds to activity feed
- **Win categorization**: Distinguishes between regular wins and big wins
- **Result details**: Captures dice combinations and win types

## 🎮 **How It Works**

### **Real-Time Activity Tracking**
1. **Player wins a game** → DiceTable processes the win
2. **Activity is logged** → Added to the activity feed with shortened address
3. **Feed updates instantly** → New win appears at the top of the list
4. **Privacy maintained** → Only shows first 4 and last 4 characters of wallet

### **Treasury Monitoring**
1. **Background service** monitors treasury wallet balance
2. **Detects balance changes** when SOL moves in/out
3. **Identifies win patterns** (treasury loses SOL = player won)
4. **Updates house bank display** in real-time

## 📊 **Activity Feed Features**
