# CeeloSol User Testing Guide

## üöÄ **Quick Start Testing**

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ installed
- Both frontend and backend running

### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Frontend
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2 - Backend  
cd backend
node dist/server.js
```

### Step 2: Access the Application

3. The wallet is automatically added to the whitelist
4. You're now logged in and can see the game interface

### Step 4: Fund Your Wallet (Devnet Only)
Since this is on devnet, you can get free SOL:
1. Copy your wallet address from the interface
2. Visit https://faucet.solana.com/
3. Paste your address and request 1-2 SOL
4. Wait a few seconds for the transaction to confirm

### Step 5: Test the Game

2. Click "Roll Dice" to start the game
3. Watch the 3D dice animation
4. See the result and any SOL transfers
